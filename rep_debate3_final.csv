4,4,2,KASICH,"Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.",1,27
5,5,2,KASICH,"I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold. I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families. I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.",1,71
6,6,2,KASICH,"We need somebody who can lead. We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...",1,15
8,8,4,KASICH,"You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.",0,27
10,10,6,HUCKABEE,"Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.",1,13
11,11,6,HUCKABEE,(LAUGHTER),5,1
12,12,6,HUCKABEE,"But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.",3,34
13,13,6,HUCKABEE,"If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules. I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid. Play by the rules.",1,40
14,14,6,HUCKABEE,And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.,1,39
16,16,8,BUSH,"You know, I am by my nature impatient. And this is not an endeavor that rewards that. You gotta be patient. You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.",1,31
17,17,8,BUSH,"But also, I can't fake anger. I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth. And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country. It's never been that way in American politics before.",4,43
18,18,9,BUSH,"I can't do it. I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down. I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.",1,44
20,20,11,RUBIO,"Thank you for that question. I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.",1,41
21,21,11,RUBIO,I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us. And that doesn't have to be true.,3,24
22,22,11,RUBIO,"Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now. If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.",3,49
24,24,13,TRUMP,"I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much. I'm too trusting. And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive. I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me. So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said ""let up.""",1,59
25,25,13,TRUMP,(LAUGHTER),5,1
27,27,15,CARSON,"Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it. I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.",1,58
28,28,15,CARSON,"And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.",1,21
30,30,17,FIORINA,"Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough. (LAUGHTER)",5,15
32,32,19,FIORINA,"But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt. I agree with them. And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected. Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years. We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.",1,70
33,33,19,FIORINA,Ours was intended to be a citizen government. This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.,1,31

36,36,21,CRUZ,(LAUGHTER),5,1
37,37,21,CRUZ,"You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite. I'm a fighter. I am passionate about what I believe. I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution. And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party. If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.",3,77
39,39,23,CHRISTIE,"I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly. Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage. You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.",1,54
40,40,23,CHRISTIE,(LAUGHTER),5,1
41,41,23,CHRISTIE,"But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it. The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.",1,71
42,42,23,CHRISTIE,"But I know who the pessimist is. It's Hillary Clinton. And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank.",1,36
44,44,25,PAUL,"You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt. We borrow a million dollars a minute. Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit. It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.",2,59
45,45,25,PAUL,I will stand firm. I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it. I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it. And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.,1,39
49,49,28,TRUMP,Right.,2,1
51,51,30,TRUMP,Right.,2,1
53,53,32,TRUMP,That's right.,3,2
57,57,34,TRUMP,"No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.",1,18
58,58,34,TRUMP,"Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan. We're reducing taxes to 15 percent. We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions. We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.",3,51
59,59,34,TRUMP,"As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall. We're going to create a border. We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally. They're going to come in legally. And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that. They built the great wall of China. That's 13,000 miles. Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1,000.",3,75
60,60,35,TRUMP,"We can do a wall. We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall. We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally. And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.",3,68
61,61,35,TRUMP,"And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay? A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay. I can. We lose, we have a trade imbalance...",1,44
62,62,35,TRUMP,"Excuse me, John.",2,3
63,63,35,TRUMP,... of $50 billion...,2,4
65,65,37,TRUMP,... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.,2,9
69,69,40,TRUMP,Right. Dynamically.,2,2
71,71,42,TRUMP,"Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.",1,31
72,72,42,TRUMP,(CROSSTALK),2,1
80,80,46,CARSON,"Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent. I used the tithing analogy.",1,19
82,82,48,CARSON,The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.,3,16
84,84,50,CARSON,You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes. You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.,1,24
85,85,50,CARSON,"Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies. Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.",3,27
86,86,50,CARSON,"So, also, we can stimulate the economy. That's gonna be the real growth engine. Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...",1,28
88,88,52,CARSON,That's not true.,2,3
90,90,54,CARSON,"When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.",3,23
92,92,56,KASICH,"Listen, I want to just comment.",1,6
94,94,58,KASICH,Well I want to comment on this. This is the fantasy...,1,11
96,96,60,KASICH,This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.,1,11
99,99,62,KASICH,I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.,1,20
100,100,62,KASICH,"You can't do it with empty promised. You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.",1,21
101,101,62,KASICH,"I actually have a plan. I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic. You just don't make promises like this.",1,40
102,102,62,KASICH,"Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes. We'll just clean it up. Where are you gonna clean it up?",1,36
103,103,62,KASICH,"You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending. You gotta be creative and imaginative.",1,23
104,104,62,KASICH,"Now, let me just be clear, John. I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus. We're up 347,000 jobs.",1,30
105,105,62,KASICH,"When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced. I was the architect. It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon. We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.",1,44
106,106,62,KASICH,"That's was hard work. Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing. Creativity.",1,11
107,107,62,KASICH,"This stuff is fantasy. Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid. Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that. It's not responsible.",1,27
110,110,64,KASICH,"Well, I mean right here. To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government? And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse? Or that we're just going to be great? Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?",2,71
111,111,64,KASICH,"Folks, we've got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job. You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.",3,34
112,112,64,KASICH,"And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio. And I will go back to Washington with my plan.",1,25
114,114,66,KASICH,"And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass. And we will be strong again. Thank you.",3,21
116,116,68,TRUMP,"First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK? He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well. Number -- and that is important for you to know.",2,39
117,117,68,TRUMP,"Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.",1,43
118,118,68,TRUMP,And Lehman Brothers started it all. He was on the board. And he was a managing general partner.,3,18
119,119,68,TRUMP,"And just thirdly, he was so nice. He was such a nice guy. And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack. But then his poll numbers tanked. He has got -- that is why he is on the end.",1,40
120,120,68,TRUMP,(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty. And he got nasty. So you know what? You can have him.,5,17
121,121,68,TRUMP,(CROSSTALK),2,1
122,122,69,KASICH,"Let me just -- let me respond. First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified. We're one of the fastest growing states in the country. We came back from the dead. And you know what? It works very, very well.",2,44
123,123,69,KASICH,"And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers. I was a banker and I was proud of it. And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.",1,43
124,124,69,KASICH,"We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work. My state is doing great across the board. And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...",1,38
126,126,71,KASICH,... an agreement with the...,2,5
127,127,71,KASICH,(CROSSTALK),2,1
128,128,72,KASICH,... that he tried to take credit for four years later. It's a joke.,2,14
132,132,75,CARSON,Since I was attacked too.,2,5
134,134,77,CARSON,"Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. You're talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.",1,37
135,135,77,CARSON,"But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.",1,41
136,136,78,CRUZ,"Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org. It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.",1,48
137,137,78,CRUZ,"After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up. The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.",3,27
138,138,78,CRUZ,"On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent. Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.",1,33
139,139,78,CRUZ,"And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.",1,43
140,140,78,CRUZ,"And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars. Those are the hard numbers. And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.",1,28
142,142,80,CRUZ,"Growth is the answer. And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.",1,17
147,147,83,FIORINA,"Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.? We have been talking about it for decades. We now have a 73,000-page tax code.",1,33
148,148,83,FIORINA,"There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone. There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.",3,34
149,149,83,FIORINA,"The problem is we never get it done. We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades. It never happens. And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.",1,40
150,150,83,FIORINA,"The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.",1,33
152,152,85,FIORINA,"That's right, three pages.",3,4
154,154,87,FIORINA,You know why three?,2,4
156,156,89,FIORINA,"No. You know why three? Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.",1,49
157,157,89,FIORINA,Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody. Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.,1,39
158,158,89,FIORINA,"So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --",2,14
160,160,91,FIORINA,-- the issue is who is going to get it done.,1,11
161,161,91,FIORINA,(CROSSTALK),2,1
165,165,95,RUBIO,That's an interesting question. That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too. Why don't you wait in line? Wait for what? This country is running out of time. We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.,1,41
166,166,95,RUBIO,"Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck. They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.",1,33
167,167,95,RUBIO,"You have small businesses in America that are struggling. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting. We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies. And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.",1,64
168,168,95,RUBIO,We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington? We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.,1,41
169,169,95,RUBIO,"The time to act is now. The time to turn the page is now. If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.",1,41
171,171,97,RUBIO,"Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement. It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.",3,25
173,173,99,RUBIO,"Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today. Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I don't recall them calling for his resignation --",1,50
175,175,101,RUBIO,"Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.",3,73
176,176,101,RUBIO,(APPLAUSE),5,1
178,178,103,BUSH,"Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work. He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field. He's a gifted politician.",3,57
179,179,103,BUSH,"But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work. I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week? You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job. There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.",1,87
180,180,104,RUBIO,"I get to respond, right?",2,5
182,182,106,RUBIO,"Well, it's interesting. Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?",1,78
183,183,107,BUSH,He wasn't my senator.,1,4
184,184,108,RUBIO,"No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you. I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record. The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.",1,51
185,185,109,BUSH,"Well, I've been --",2,4
186,186,110,RUBIO,Here's the bottom line.,2,4
187,187,110,RUBIO,(APPLAUSE),5,1
188,188,110,RUBIO,"I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage. I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.",1,73
190,190,112,TRUMP,I think you're --,2,4
191,191,112,TRUMP,(APPLAUSE),5,1
192,192,112,TRUMP,(CROSSTALK),2,1
195,195,114,KASICH,"John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.",3,7
200,200,118,BUSH,"No, no. What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.",1,29
202,202,120,BUSH,"Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.",2,14
204,204,122,BUSH,"But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.",1,40
207,207,124,BUSH,"(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future. They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.",3,26
208,208,124,BUSH,They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back. There are lids on people's aspirations. Think about it six and a half million people working part-time. Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.,1,38
209,209,124,BUSH,"Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same. We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.",1,48
210,210,124,BUSH,And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.,3,8
218,218,128,FIORINA,"You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover. I was recruited to H.P. to save a company.",1,30
219,219,128,FIORINA,"It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders. It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.",1,38
220,220,128,FIORINA,"As an outsider, I tackled H.P.'s entrenched problems head-on. I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.",1,32
221,221,128,FIORINA,"And yes, it was a very difficult time. However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.",2,42
222,222,128,FIORINA,"The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times. I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now. And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom. There are politics in the boardroom as well.",2,44
223,223,128,FIORINA,"And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, ""you know what? We were wrong. She was right. She was a great CEO. She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P. is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.",3,60
227,227,130,FIORINA,"Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.",1,18
228,228,130,FIORINA,(LAUGHTER),5,1

241,241,135,CRUZ,"You know, let me say something at the outset. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.",1,29
242,242,135,CRUZ,"(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match. And, you look at the questions -- ""Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"" ""Ben Carson, can you do math?""

252,252,140,CRUZ,"Let me be clear. The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.",3,37

274,274,152,PAUL,"No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items. That's what they're doing. They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.",1,47
275,275,152,PAUL,"Here's the thing. When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government. In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government. Instead, the Washington establishment raised both. We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this. This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left. Right and left are spending us into oblivion. We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.",1,100
277,277,154,PAUL,"Well, that's a real question. Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership? I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same. People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this. Well, you know what I'm worried about? Not keeping the government open. I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.",1,79
278,278,154,PAUL,We're borrowing a million dollars a minute. That is important. And that's what we have to contrast. Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.,2,30
279,279,154,PAUL,(CROSSTALK),2,1
284,284,157,CHRISTIE,"Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it. I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home. The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you. They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund. All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.",1,76
285,285,157,CHRISTIE,"And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years. We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service. And, that's with zero percent interest rates.",1,56
286,286,157,CHRISTIE,"Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements. And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton. What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.",1,55
287,287,157,CHRISTIE,"Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there. If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more? Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend. We need to get realistic about this. We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from. And...",2,91

292,292,162,HUCKABEE,"Well, I would really appreciate that. First of all, yes, we've stolen. Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.",1,24
293,293,162,HUCKABEE,"But, you know what we're not telling them? It's their money. This isn't the governments money. This is not entitlement, it's not welfare. This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks. Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it. Now, we're going to blame the people.",1,61
294,294,162,HUCKABEE,"Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money. That makes no sense to everybody. And, they're always going to say, ""Well, we're going to fix this one day.""",1,39
295,295,162,HUCKABEE,"No their not. It's like a 400 pound man saying, ""I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do.""",1,28
296,296,162,HUCKABEE,"And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this. But, let me tell you who not to blame. Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security. Let's quit making it a problem for them. It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more. You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...",1,72

326,326,186,CRUZ,"Well, sure. This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken. Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.",1,33
327,327,186,CRUZ,"And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right. Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look. I'm 44 years old.",1,53
328,328,186,CRUZ,"It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us. We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.",1,82
330,330,188,HUCKABEE,"John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income. And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means. If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it. If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?",1,85
331,331,189,HUCKABEE,"Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in. I just want to remind you, people paid their money. They expect to have it. And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.",1,75

341,341,192,TRUMP,"Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman. Atlantic City has gone bad. I mean, Chris will know about that. I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that. Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy. Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.",1,73
342,342,192,TRUMP,"But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself. I never filed for bankruptcy. But many, many people did. What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.",1,42
343,343,192,TRUMP,"Now hundreds of companies I've opened. I've used it three times, maybe four times. Came out great. But I guess I'm supposed to come out great. That is what I could do for the country. We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems. Nobody can solve it like me.",1,53
344,344,192,TRUMP,"But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived. I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds. And I'm glad I did it.",1,46

350,350,196,CARSON,"Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people. What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American? And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.",1,65
351,351,196,CARSON,"Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee. Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.",1,43
352,352,196,CARSON,"So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.",1,38
353,353,196,CARSON,"The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.",1,21
358,358,198,CHRISTIE,"You bet they do. And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be. The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.",1,33
359,359,198,CHRISTIE,"It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are. They like General Motors, so they give them a pass. They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace. It's a political Justice Department.",1,53
360,360,198,CHRISTIE,"And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies. We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders. We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.",3,42
361,361,198,CHRISTIE,"And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already. We don't need newer (ph) laws. We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?",1,63
362,362,198,CHRISTIE,"So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on. Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word. It will be a way of life.",3,56
367,367,201,BUSH,"Well, the deal was done. Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts. You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation. And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.",1,49
368,368,201,BUSH,"And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president. And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.",1,39
369,369,201,BUSH,"We need to reverse that. And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year. You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record. $19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.",1,64
371,371,203,BUSH,You find me...,2,3
373,373,205,BUSH,"You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars? Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars. I'll talk to them.",1,34
375,375,207,BUSH,"Look, the -- the deal is already done. The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up. You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.",3,42
376,376,207,BUSH,(LAUGHTER),5,1
380,380,210,FIORINA,"You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about. Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.",3,32
381,381,210,FIORINA,What's crony capitalism? Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.,3,26
382,382,210,FIORINA,"So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating? Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street? Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.",1,70
383,383,210,FIORINA,"You see, folks, this is how socialism starts. Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem. This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.",1,32
384,384,210,FIORINA,"The student loan problem has been created by government. Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem. The FCC jumping in now and saying, ""we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet,"" is going to create massive problems.",1,47
385,385,210,FIORINA,But guess who pushed for that regulation? The big Internet companies. This is what's going on. Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.,3,27
386,386,210,FIORINA,It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid. It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together. It's you see the health insurance companies getting together. It's why you see the banks consolidating.,3,32
387,387,210,FIORINA,"And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed. Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed. Community banks are going out of business. Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.",3,41
389,389,212,FIORINA,It is why we have to simplify. It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.,1,20
391,391,214,FIORINA,It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.,1,17
396,396,217,RUBIO,"Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all. But I'm going to tell you the truth.",1,36
397,397,217,RUBIO,"Here's the truth. I didn't inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid. They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.",1,30
398,398,217,RUBIO,"They didn't save enough money for us to go to school. I had to work my way through school. I had to borrow money to go to school. I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.",1,54
399,399,217,RUBIO,(LAUGHTER),5,1
400,400,217,RUBIO,"I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard. We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.",1,31
401,401,217,RUBIO,"We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in. My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.",3,50
402,402,217,RUBIO,"But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more. And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.",1,50
403,403,217,RUBIO,This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.,1,37
405,405,219,RUBIO,"And I used it to pay off my loans. And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.",1,21
406,406,219,RUBIO,(APPLAUSE),5,1
408,408,221,RUBIO,"Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.",1,29
409,409,221,RUBIO,"It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book. I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families. And I make a lot more than the average American. Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.",1,80
410,410,221,RUBIO,We can't afford another four years of that. Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.,1,28
411,411,221,RUBIO,"Thank you, senator.",3,3
415,415,223,KASICH,"Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare. If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well. Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive. Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.",0,94
416,416,223,KASICH,"I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.",2,17

419,419,223,KASICH,"I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget. We actually did it. And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.",1,41
420,420,223,KASICH,"Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes. You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy. So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.",3,67
421,421,223,KASICH,"And you know what? Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...",3,41

429,429,228,CRUZ,"The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.",1,19
430,430,228,CRUZ,"You know, you look at women working. I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family. My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms. My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.",2,58
431,431,228,CRUZ,"Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary. And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.",1,82
432,432,228,CRUZ,"Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733. The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations. And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics. That is who I'm fighting for. The people that Washington leaves behind.",1,73

434,434,229,FIORINA,"Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.",1,37
435,435,230,FIORINA,92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women. Senator Cruz is precisely right. Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration. The number of women --,1,37

465,465,246,RUBIO,"The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms. For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days. You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.",1,67
466,466,246,RUBIO,"But here's the best solution of all. We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century. Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work. But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs. But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.",1,133
467,467,246,RUBIO,But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.,3,22
470,470,248,RUBIO,"Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.",0,44
474,474,251,TRUMP,"I was not at all critical of him. I was not at all. In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people. They go to Harvard.

560,560,292,BUSH,"Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do. You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.",1,47

581,581,304,RUBIO,"...numerically, it's gonna be higher. But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.",1,43
582,582,304,RUBIO,"We are lowering taxes on small business. You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning. He's an S corporation.

599,599,318,PAUL,"Alright. Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class. In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals. Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well. It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.",1,74
600,600,318,PAUL,"If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut. Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.",0,52

We could do a whole show on that.",3,82
617,617,332,KASICH,"I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality. My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.",1,66
618,618,332,KASICH,"The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety. I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.",1,101

638,638,342,RUBIO,"But in 2015, we have a very different economy. Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based. It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.",3,60
642,642,345,TRUMP,Yes.,2,1
644,644,347,TRUMP,Or somebody else. Right.,2,4
646,646,349,TRUMP,"Yes, I might feel more comfortable. I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry. And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot. But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)",5,51

They look around for gun-free zones. You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed. Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns. And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them. If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long. I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.",1,102

676,676,364,CHRISTIE,"John, I'll tell you something. You want to talk about moral authority. Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news. You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law. And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.",1,85
677,677,364,CHRISTIE,"And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers? Does he stand up for law enforcement? No, he doesn't.

803,803,422,CARSON,"And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about. How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, ""intellect,"" in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?",2,45

834,834,436,FIORINA,I would like to start with a basic. Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent. It's kind of basic.

835,835,436,FIORINA,"My point is this. While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.

Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem. We need to rebuild our families. We need to have stronger families. We need to know who our neighbors are. We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down. Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods. We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will. And God bless America.",4,132
