486,250,TAPPER,Welcome to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate. No topic perhaps has been more combustible in this campaign than the issue of immigration.,0.5
487,250,TAPPER,"Mr. Trump, you have called for deporting every undocumented immigrant, Governor Christie has said, quote, ""There are not enough law enforcement officers - local, county, state and federal combined - to forcibly deport 11 to 12 million people.""",0.16666666666666666
488,250,TAPPER,"Tell Governor Christie how much your plan will cost, and how you will get it done.",0.2
489,251,TRUMP,"Correct. First of all, I want to build a wall, a wall that works. So important, and it's a big part of it.",0.25
490,251,TRUMP,"Second of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside, and I think Chris knows that, maybe as well as anybody.",-0.23333333333333328
491,251,TRUMP,"They go, if I get elected, first day they're gone. Gangs all over the place. Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you look.",0.25
492,251,TRUMP,"We have a country based on laws. I will make sure that those laws are adhered to. These are illegal immigrants. I don't think you'd even be asking this question if I didn't run because when I ran, and I brought this up, my opening remarks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time. And, then they found out with the killing of Katie, from San Francisco, and so many other crimes, they found out that I was right.",-0.05
493,251,TRUMP,"And, most people, many people, apologized to me. I don't think you'd even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for me. So, we have a country of laws, they're going to go out, and they'll come back if they deserve to come back. If they've had a bad record, if they've been arrested, if they've been in jail, they're never coming back. We're going to have a country again. Right now, we don't have a country, we don't have a border, and we're going to do something about it, and it can be done with proper management, and it can be done with heart.",0.14285714285714285
494,252,TAPPER,"Governor Christie, you and I have talked about this in an interview. You say that his big wall, his plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, it sounds great, but it's never going to happen.",0.4
495,252,TAPPER,Tell him why you're skeptical of his plans?,-0.5
496,253,CHRISTIE,"First of, Jake, I don't yield to anybody on how to enforce the law. I'm the only person on this stage who spent seven years as a United States Attorney after September 11th, and I know how to do this.",-0.05
497,253,CHRISTIE,"The fact is though that for 15,000 people a day to be deported every day for two years is an undertaking that almost none of us could accomplish given the current levels of funding, and the current number of law enforcement officers. Here's what we need to do, and I think this is where Donald is absolutely right. What we need to do is to secure our border, and we need to do it with more than just a wall.",0.0
498,253,CHRISTIE,"We need to use electronics, we need to use drones, we need to use FBI, DEA, and ATF, and yes, we need to take the fingerprint of every person who comes into this country on a visa, and when they overstay their visa, we need to tap them on the shoulder, and say, ""You have overstayed your welcome, you're taking advantage of the American people. It's time for you to go.""",0.4

503,256,TAPPER,"Why do you say that, Dr. Carson?",0.0
504,257,CARSON,"Well, first of all, I recognize that we have an incredible illegal immigration problem. I was down in Arizona a few weeks ago at the border. I mean, the fences that were there were not manned, and those are the kind of fences when I was a kid that would barely slow us down. So, I don't see any purpose in having that.",-0.04201388888888891
505,257,CARSON,"Now, what we need to do is look at something that actually works. Yuma County, Arizona. They stop 97 percent of the illegal immigrants through there. They put in a double fence with a road so that there was quick access by the enforcement people.",0.16666666666666666
506,257,CARSON,"If we don't seal the border, the rest of this stuff clearly doesn't matter. It's kind of ridiculous all the other things we talk about. We have the ability to do it, we don't have the will to do it.",0.10000000000000002
